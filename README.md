# Dvorak - Designed for the UK Keyboard

This config copies the Dvorak-CmdQwerty Keyboard readily available to download from karabiner elements, but I made some custom changes to the keyboard.
- When typing regularly it has a Dvorak layout
- When typing with caps lock on it **still** has the Dvorak layout
- When clicking Control, Option or Command, it switches the keys to Qwerty. (Better when executing keyboard shortcuts IMO)
- Small tweaks for a UK keyboard: Grave accent & tile, non US backslash etc.
